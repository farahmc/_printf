.SH NAME
.B _printf - function to produce output according to format.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
_printf(constant char *format, ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fB_printf\fR displays output to \fBstdout\fR (standard output
stream). The format string is composed of zero or more directives, and handles
conversion specifiers which specifies how arguments are converted for output.

.B Format of required argument
Format is a character string composed of zero or more directives. Ordinary
characters are copied unchanged to the output stream, and conversion
specification which fetches 0 or more arguments. Conversion specification
is introduced with \fB%\fR followed by one of the a character described in
\fBCONVERSION SPECIFIER\fR.

.B Return Value
.br
Upon success, \fB_printf\fR returns the number of characters printed, excluding
the null byte.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The character \fB%\fR is followed by zero or more of the following conversion
specifiers:
.br
.B c
.br
- Prints a single character. The int argument is converted to an unsigned char.
.br
.B s
.br
- Prints a string. The constant char * argument is expected to be a pointer to a
string (array of chars). Characters from the array are written up to (but not
including) a terminating null byte.
.br
.B d, i
.br
- Prints integer. The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.br
.B b
.br
- Prints an unsigned integer. The unsigned int argument is converted to binary.
.br
.B o, u, x, X
.br
- Prints an unsigned integer. The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned
octal (\fBo\fR), unsigned decimal (\fBu\fR), or unsigned hexadecimal (\fBx\fR,
\fBX\fR) notation. The letters \fBabcdef\fR are used for \fBx\fR conversions and
the letters \fBABCDEF\fR used for \fBX\fR conversions.
